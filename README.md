«I am the owner of a comic book store chain, I need to develop an app that will be downloadable by qr code. The essence of the application, you just need to make a collection of all the characters of the cartoon Rick and Morty. Add the ability to search for them. Each character's parameters should be displayed: Alive or not, race, location when last seen, and the name of the series where he first appeared. All of this should work quickly and with nice animations. The design is not designed, you will have to do it at your own discretion, the wish is that it be simple and clean»
